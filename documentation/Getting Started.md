# Getting Started

This is an Astro theme. It features many components and their variations. Astro generates the app based on the contents of the [Pages](../src/pages/) folder. As such, this template can provide tons of features without bloating the final bundle size of the finished product.

The intent of this template is to provide a good running start for an effective static site for the purposes of freelancing. It represents an ideal set of features to cover most use-cases of small business, restaurants, tradesmen, contractors, etc. The approach is to have a good default theme that is easy to change to fit the needs of the customer. For the developer, the most important thing is to get out of the way and make implementing the content the most important thing.

## Recommended Approach:
1) Fill out your [Site Summary](/Site%20Summary.md) first. This section contains side wide metadata. Configure things like the name of your site, choose logo file, description of site, etc.
2) Next, [Configure your colors](/Configure%20Theme.md). Choose your primary and accent colors, and more.
3) Then, [configure your theme](/Configure%20Theme.md). Here you can customize dark and light theme, which colors to use where, spacing, fonts, shadows, and more.
4) [Configure the Layout](/Configure%20Layout.md). The Layout file defines what's in common for every page on the site. Configure the layout to customize metadata, layout, and more. Be default it contains just a header and a footer. 
5) Once your happy with the look and feel of the site, start [customizing your home page](/Customize%20Index%20Page.md) by choosing components to include such as a hero or feature cards.
6) [Add some content](/Writing%20Content.md)! This template makes it easy to add services and features you can provide, or write some blog posts. You don't need to make individual pages for these things, let the template do the heavy lifting.
